# BreakHis-DeepNN
BreakHis Dataset consist of 7109 images collected from 82 different Breast Cancer patients under 4 magnifications. This repository is under progress and will provide in depth analysis on classification of images into being Benign or Malignant. I am using pre-trained Deep Neural Network and using Transfer Learning, because data set is big and requires high computation power.
